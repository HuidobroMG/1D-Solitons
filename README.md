# Solitons-1D

In this repository you may find some codes which solve the dynamics of 1-dimensional topological solitons in 3 different theories. More concretely, I consider the $\phi^4$, $\phi^6$ and double sine-Gordon theories, which differ in the potential term. In each case the symmetric collision of the corresponding kink and antikink solutions is solved with an initial ingoing velocity, then the plot of the collision is shown and the option to create a GIF is possible.

The differences between the .py codes and the jupyter notebooks is that the full field theoretical collision is considered with no approximations, i.e. the equation of motion, which is just a generalization of the simple Klein-Gordon equation is solved, in the .py cases. In the jupyter notebooks we consider the collisions under the collective coordinates (CC) approximation, in which the degrees of freedom in the system are reduced to a finite, or countable infinite in the perturbative collective coordinate (pCC) approximation, number of variables.

In the jupyter notebooks not only a single collision can be obtained, but they perform a scan of different ingoing initial velocities and show the collision diagram of the theory in the CC approximation.
